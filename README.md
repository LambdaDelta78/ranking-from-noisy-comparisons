# ranking-from-noisy-comparisons

The codes are for our paper 
"Ren, W., Liu, J. K., & Shroff, N. (2019). On Sample Complexity Upper and Lower Bounds for Exact Ranking from Noisy Comparisons. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 10014-10024)."

All entities can use the codes as long as you cite this work.

"RankingMainFile.cpp" is the entry and contains the codes to generate instances.
"RankingAlgoriths.h" contains the implementations of the ranking algorithms that are used in our paper.
"HelperFunctions.h" contains some helper functions for the ranking algorithms.
